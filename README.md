## Overview
The NWU Tech Trends Telemetry API is a RESTful API that tracks the amount of time saved by Tech Trends' automations. This telemetry data is utilized to determine the cost savings related with each automation and organize it by project and customer. The API acts as a back-end service, recording and retrieving telemetry data to provide essential information into the efficiency and cost effect of automations.
