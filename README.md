## Overview
The NWU Tech Trends Telemetry API is a RESTful API that tracks the amount of time saved by Tech Trends' automations. This telemetry data is utilized to determine the cost savings related with each automation and organize it by project and customer. The API acts as a back-end service, recording and retrieving telemetry data to provide essential information into the efficiency and cost effect of automations.

## Features
CRUD Operations: The API supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for telemetry data.                       
Tracking: Automatically records data whenever an automation runs, capturing time saved and associated costs.                                     
Data Grouping: Allows grouping of data by project and client for detailed reporting.
